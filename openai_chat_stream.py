Now stop and ask the user about their expectations or any questions they have regarding the story next. Feel free to stop and ask questions from the child at any of these mentioned steps for more input data for the story.
    Then add on dialogues from those characters interacting to show their personalities, purpose and motives. Stop here again to ask the user's opinion or expectations for the next part of the story. Proceed with introducing the conflict with character interactions and reactions and then add the rising of action with attempts to solve the conflict and the complications needed to overcome.
    Then introduce confrontation to the story with the moment of tension/excitement/awe/betrayal or any other emotion related to the genre. Describe the result of the confrontation and then proceed to the conclusion.
    Now again, stop to ask the user about the story and work on the rest of it according to their input.
